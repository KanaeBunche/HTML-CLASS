- `<html lang="en">`: Wraps all HTML content; `lang="en"` specifies the language as English, aiding accessibility tools.
- `<head>`: Contains metadata about the document, not directly visible to the user but important for browsers and search engines.
  - `<meta charset="UTF-8">`: Specifies the character encoding as UTF-8, supporting a wide range of characters.
  - `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`: Ensures responsive design on different screen sizes.
  - `<title>Book Report: To Kill a Mockingbird</title>`: Sets the page title shown on the browser tab.
